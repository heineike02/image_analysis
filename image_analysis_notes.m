%Image Analysis Notes: 

%To Do: 
% implement a way to use lactis specific parameters (cell radius in
% NEnrich fixed at 6 right now). 
% Integrate my cell finder with Susan's Cell Tracker
% Implement Cell Finder with Bright Field Images
% Set up a Git-Hub for lab shared code.
% Get cell tracking software to adjust based on time interval? 

% Filter cells with low median brightness? 

% To get information out of meadata look for each FrameKey, and inside
% check the Channel, Summary, Exposure-ms, Time, Width, Height

%Questions: 
    %Why use a convolution (which reverses and shifts something) instead of
    %a cross-correlation which just shifts? (in NEnrich)
%  Why use Conv Lucy?
